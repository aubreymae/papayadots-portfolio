                <p>Aubrey Garcia is a designer and illustrator who has dabbled in a wide variety of projects. From web and mobile, to newer emerging technologies like virtual and augmented reality, she likes to combine her deep passion for art with technology.</p>
        
                <p>Graduating with honours from the Digital Media program at York University, she collaborated with students from various discplines like business, design, dance, and theatre. While Aubrey often filled the technical roles, she still sought after leadership roles because of her balanced understanding of programming, development, and design.</p>
        
                <p>She knows a variety of programming languages such as Java, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is continually learning more on her own time (C# and C++ for her augmented reality app ideas). Moreover, she is well-versed in the design and usability testing workflow and uses multiple applications to achieve them (Sketch, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Affinity Photo and Designer).</p>
        
                <p>She is continually trying to push the limits to her creativity and when she's not designing, she spends her time drawing, painting, and writing stories. She wonders if she should mention video games in this section... yes, of course, she loves video games and she cannot wait for The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk 2077 to be released.</p>
        
                <p>Lastly, Aubrey doesn't actually speak in third person, in person.</p>
