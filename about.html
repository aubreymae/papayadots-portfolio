                <p>Aubrey Garcia is an interaction designer who has dabbled in a wide variety of development projects from web and mobile and to newer emerging technologies like virtual and augmented reality. At the heart of her work lies the need to create work that speaks for it's users; it's ultimately understanding how technology can better fit in to people's lives that has become one of her life's goal.</p>
        
                <p>Graduating with honours from the Digital Media program at York University where she partook in various collaborative experience with students from various discplines like business, design, dance, and theatre, Aubrey often filled the more technically-heavy and leadership roles in these projects. Every idea offered up had it's own layers of challenges; but despite it's daunting size, the fear it carried was a necessity to push each project to a successful completion.</p>
        
                <p>She knows a variety of programming languages such as Java, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is continually learning more on her own time (C# and C++ for her augmented reality app ideas). Moreover, she is well-versed in the design and usability testing workflow and uses multiple applications to achieve them (Sketch, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Affinity Photo and Designer).</p>
        
                <p>Aubrey truly shines when she can balance creativity and technicality. Just as much as she loves technology, she carries an equal passion for art and storytelling. She loves to draw, paint, and write stories and she is still in the process of creating her own comic book. She wonders if she should mention video games in this section... yes, of course, she loves video games and she cannot wait for The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk 2077 to be released.</p>
        
                <p>Lastly, Aubrey doesn't actually speak in third person, in person.</p>
