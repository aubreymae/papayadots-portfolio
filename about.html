            <div class="about-me-desc">
                <p>Aubrey Garcia is an interactive media designer and developer who has dabbled in a wide variety of projects. From web and mobile, to newer emerging technologies like virtual and augmented reality, at the heart of her work is the concern of human-centered design. Understanding how technology can better fit in to people's lives that has become one of her life's goals.</p>
        
                <p>Graduating with honours from the Digital Media program at York University, she collaborated with students from various discplines like business, design, dance, and theatre. While Aubrey often filled the technical roles, she still sought after leadership roles because of her balanced understanding of programming, development, and design. Directing a project is daunting because every idea offered up had it's own layers of challenges, but despite it, every idea found it's successful completion.</p>
        
                <p>She knows a variety of programming languages such as Java, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is continually learning more on her own time (C# and C++ for her augmented reality app ideas). Moreover, she is well-versed in the design and usability testing workflow and uses multiple applications to achieve them (Sketch, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Affinity Photo and Designer).</p>
        
                <p>Aubrey truly shines when she can balance creativity and technicality. Just as much as she loves technology, she carries an equal passion for art and storytelling. She loves to draw, paint, and write stories and she is still in the process of creating her own comic book. She wonders if she should mention video games in this section... yes, of course, she loves video games and she cannot wait for The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk 2077 to be released.</p>
        
                <p>Lastly, Aubrey doesn't actually speak in third person, in person.</p>
