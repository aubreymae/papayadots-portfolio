        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>As part of York International's mental health campaign, YIFeel, I helped design the campaign page on the website. YIFeel is a campaign that aims to bring awareness to the often inaccessible mental health resources for international students at York University. The page acts as the one-stop shop for interested students on knowing the latest news and events about the campaign.</p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/yifeel/yifeel.jpg" width="100%" height="800px"/>
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="annotations"><p>Figure 1. YIFeel page design</p></div>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>I designed the page using the Bootstrap framework and WordPress plugins. To make the mockups, I used Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Designer.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>I first started by collaborating with the other student leaders or Global Liasions and then liased with the York International full-time faculty to determine what must be included on the page. Working alongside another student, we gathered our feedback and formed a rough idea of the page.</p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/yifeel/yifeel-mockup-rough1.jpg" width="95%" height="95%" />
            </a>
            <a href="/assets/yifeel/yifeel-mockup-rough2.jpg">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/yifeel/yifeel-mockup-rough2.jpg" width="95%" height="95%" />
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="annotations"><p>Figures 2 and 3. Page mockup scratch with design annotations.</p></div>

        <p>Then we needed to fill the page with content, so we talked with the marketing team to create the appropriate text for each heading. Afterwards, we mapped out the skeleton and started filling it in with content. Pictures were later added after being edited on Photoshop.</p>

            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="annotations"><p>Figure 3. Digital mockup made in Illustrator and Affinity Designer.</p></div>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>I'm very happy with the resulting page because I think it utilizes the strength of the campaign which are the posters.</p>
