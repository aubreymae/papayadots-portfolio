        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Moon Box is an interactive light installation that uses atmospheric data to create a simulation of a fantastical dimension within a closed, "floating" box. Based on the moon gate, an architectural element found in many houses and gardens in Chinese culture, Moon Box is meant to function as a portal to a new space in the same way the moon gate functions as a dividing archway between two often different spaces.</p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>I was in charge of systems programming which involved transferring the collected atmospheric data into values that influence the colour, frequency, and intensity of the LED lights inside the box.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Moon Box takes atmospheric data (humidity, temperature, and dew point) using a DHT11 sensor. Then, the data collected is used to change the colour, frequency, and intensity of the LED lights nestled within the "clouds" (which were made out of cotton balls!).</p>

        <p>The participant interacts with the box by inserting their head through a circular opening below the box. The interior walls are covered in mirrors and the bottom plane (at the same side as the hole) is littered with cotton balls or "clouds". When the participant enters the box, they are met with the never-ending tunnel effect created by the mirrors and coupled with the changing lights of the LED, it will hopefully seem like a fantasy.</p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>I'm very proud of the execution and the presentation of the project, but I think that the environmental sensing system could have been much more complex. Instead of solely using atmospheric data on the LEDs, it could have been used on other outputs like music or even on motion (possibly moving the clouds). Moreover, there are other atmospheric inputs that should be explored such as air quality, water vapour, or air pressure.</p>
