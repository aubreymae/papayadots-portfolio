        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>As part of my Mobile User Interface class, I built an Android app mimicking that of Luminosity's Speed Match game. Luminosity is a brain-training mobile app and Speed Match works as simply matching a card presented in front of you to the previous that you've just seen.</p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Being an individual final project, I designed and coded the app, completed the usability tests on the participants myself, and wrote the paper.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>I wanted to compare the difference of two gestural inputs, swipe and button, on user performance. I measured task completion time, reaction time, rate of right and wrong answers, number of touches, and touch lengths. Then, I conducted a usability test where I asked participants to complete 10 trials (10 iterations of a full game).</p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Prior to the usability test, I reasoned that participants would take to the Button interface better than the Swipe because it's more ergonomically easier to play. The Button interface allowed for two-handed play whereas the Swipe interface meant that participants used it with only one.</p>

        <p>After aggregating the data on each independent variable, I found that the Button interface outperformed the Swipe interface by only a small margin. Participants generally completed a game one second faster with the Button interface than the Swipe. There aren't significant differences between the two interfaces in terms of reaction time, rate of right and wrong answers, and number of touches. The Swipe interface produced longer touches because, I reasoned, the action itself takes longer than pressing a button. Overall, there wasn't one interface that significantly outperformed the other.</p>

        <p>The data collected for the questionnaire, however, showed that participants thought the Swipe gesture was more distracting, required more physical effort, and hindered their ability to play the game properly. The Button interface in this sense performed more positively than the Swipe.</p>

        <p>But despite the large favour for the Buttons interface, participant feedback revealed that the Swipe gesture was more forgiving as the action can be "undone" whereas the Buttons were hard to recover from. Another participant noted the potential of the Swipe gesture to develop to the same ease of use as the Buttons after a longer period of usage (practicing with it and developing a more natural affinity).</p>

        <p>There were still some problems that existed in the test. Touch sensitivity and the problem of Swipe not always registering at first and having to repeat the action. Some instances the game itself crashed and left the participant to re-doing a trial. Some surprising revelations was the fact that swiping would take the participant's attention during game play which many participants shared. While there exixted some personal preferences over the two interfaces, the user performance results showed that one input method had no clear advantage over the other. Moreover, if the usability test was done over a period of time, there may be an increase in this difference. A longitudinal study of this sort would also have to consider the way that the participant's brain is trained (processing time) to complete match-making.</p>
